## About Me
<span id="about" style="display: block; margin-top: -100px; padding-top: 100px;"></span>
Greetings,😀! I'm Wenjing Gong, a second-year Ph.D. student in Urban and Regional Science at Texas A&M University, co-advised by <a href="https://www.arch.tamu.edu/staff/lingqian-ivy-hu/" target="_blank">Dr. Lingqian Hu</a> and <a href="https://geography.ua.edu/people/xinyue-ye/" target="_blank">Dr. Xinyue Ye</a>. My current research interests include:  
* **Urban Analytics and Geospatial AI**: Advancing methods in multimodal data fusion and AI-driven analytics to enhance urban extreme weather and environmental risk assessment and modeling.
* **Human–Environment–Climate Nexus**: Investigating the coupled interactions of climate extremes, urban systems, and human behavior to foster sustainable, resilient, and healthy urban futures.  
* **Social Sensing and Visual Intelligence**: Harnessing geospatial imagery, mobility data, and social media to reveal urban dynamics and inform urban planning and policy.

Feel free to contact me via email or LinkedIn. I’d be happy to connect!
